VittoriaDB RAG System - Comprehensive Documentation

Introduction
VittoriaDB is a high-performance vector database designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. This system provides ultra-fast semantic search capabilities using advanced embedding technologies.

Architecture Overview
The VittoriaDB RAG system consists of several key components:

1. Vector Database Core
The core database engine handles vector storage, indexing, and retrieval operations. It supports multiple distance metrics including cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product similarity. The system uses HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for optimal search performance.

2. Embedding Services
Multiple embedding services are supported:
- OpenAI Embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002): 1536 dimensions, ultra-fast API-based generation
- Sentence Transformers: Local embedding generation with models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- Hugging Face Transformers: Remote API access to various embedding models
- Ollama: Local LLM-based embeddings for privacy-focused deployments

3. Text Processing Pipeline
The text processing pipeline handles document ingestion, chunking, and preprocessing:
- Automatic text chunking for large documents to fit within token limits
- Smart boundary detection (sentences, paragraphs, word boundaries)
- Overlap management to maintain context across chunks
- Metadata preservation and enhancement

4. Search and Retrieval
Advanced search capabilities include:
- Semantic similarity search using vector embeddings
- Hybrid search combining vector and text-based approaches
- Filtered search with metadata constraints
- Multi-collection search across different document types
- Real-time search with sub-second response times

Performance Characteristics
The system has been optimized for high-performance operations:

Indexing Performance:
- OpenAI embeddings: ~0.1-0.5 seconds per document
- Local embeddings: ~1-5 seconds per document
- Batch processing: Up to 10x faster than individual insertions
- Concurrent processing: Multiple documents processed simultaneously

Search Performance:
- Sub-second response times for most queries
- HNSW indexing provides logarithmic search complexity
- Configurable precision vs speed trade-offs
- Memory-efficient operations for large collections

API Endpoints
The system provides comprehensive REST API endpoints:

Document Management:
- POST /upload: Upload and process documents
- POST /documents/batch: Batch document insertion
- GET /documents: List documents with pagination
- DELETE /documents/{id}: Remove documents

Search Operations:
- POST /search: Semantic search across collections
- GET /search/suggestions: Query suggestions and autocomplete
- POST /search/similar: Find similar documents

Collection Management:
- GET /collections: List available collections
- POST /collections: Create new collections
- DELETE /collections/{name}: Remove collections

GitHub Integration:
- POST /github/index: Index GitHub repositories
- GET /github/status: Check indexing status
- POST /github/webhook: Handle GitHub webhooks
